	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Represents a single chunk of the terrain. Instances of this class are duplicated by [JarVoxelTerrain] for each chunk generated.
		It manages the [CollisionShape3D] and [MeshInstance3D] nodes for collision and rendering. The main node structure is based on a [StaticBody3D], with these elements as children.
