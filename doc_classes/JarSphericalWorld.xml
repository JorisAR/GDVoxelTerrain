	<description>
		Defines a spherical world, simulating a planet-like environment.
		This is used in conjunction with [JarVoxelTerrain] to determine whether the terrain is rendered as a flat plane or a sphere.
		The size of the sphere is controlled by the [code]sphere_radius[/code] property, which sets the distance from the center to the planet's surface (considered the 0-level height).
